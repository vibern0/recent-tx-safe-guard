# Security dependency review

**Review date:** 2026-09-28
**Status:** Testnet security research baseline; not audited or production-ready.

This allowlist pins exact npm versions. Integrity values are the npm registry `dist.integrity` values queried on the review date. Later deployment verification resolves official registry addresses, fetches runtime code, hashes it, and fails closed on missing or mismatched data.

Safe v1.5 module guards are a hard requirement for later integration. The old `@gnosis.pm/safe-contracts@1.3.0` dependency is deliberately rejected and removed because the historical prototype predates module guards and is not an acceptable security baseline.

## Rejected versions and paths

- `@gnosis.pm/safe-contracts@1.3.0`: rejected; historical-only dependency and permissive mock integration.
- Zodiac Roles `2.1.0` and Delay `1.1.0`: rejected as vulnerable releases identified by the research baseline. No old deployment address is reused.
- Safe Research Policy Engine: rejected as a deployment dependency. Reviewed prior-art commit is `405ba1d91e85d0fd26abf0f645bf216822c8c595` from `safe-research/policy-engine` `main` on 2026-09-17. Its README warns that it is unaudited and may contain serious security holes. It is not compiled, deployed, or trusted by this repository.

## Evidence limits

Task 1 establishes reproducible package resolution and preserves the historical code. It does not verify deployed addresses, chain-specific runtime bytecode, Safe/passkey/Zodiac audit scope, or a production deployment. Those are explicit later-task gates. Missing RPC data, unknown releases, mismatched hashes, or absent audit evidence must fail closed.

Task 3 adds pinned official Safe deployment registry evidence for Sepolia Safe v1.5 singleton, Safe proxy factory, and MultiSendCallOnly. It replaces the old generic MultiSend registry role with MultiSendCallOnly because the atomic setup transport must not accept delegate-call multisend behavior. The resolver still reads live bytecode before branding infrastructure; committed addresses and hashes alone are not sufficient.

The committed registry pins Sepolia runtime evidence for the [v0.2.0 factory](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules-deployments/blob/main/src/assets/safe-passkey-module/v0.2.0/safe-webauthn-signer-factory.json) and [Daimo verifier](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules-deployments/blob/main/src/assets/safe-passkey-module/v0.2.0/daimo-p256-verifier.json). `npm run verify:dependencies` now verifies all five public dependencies onchain and stops successfully before a credential-specific signer exists. A supplied signer address, code hash, factory binding, and current deployer nonce trigger the full resolver path. This validates source-address/runtime consistency, not an independent audit of the passkey release.

The selected passkey signer instance is component evidence, not an official Safe deployment. Task 3 verifies it only from an exact address, runtime code hash, and read-only `getSigner(x, y, verifiers)` binding through the verified passkey signer factory. Config-shaped JSON and cloned objects cannot produce the resolver brand. Guard, Zodiac Delay, and maintenance instance verification is deliberately deferred to Task 4 after their planned transactions succeed and immediately before Safe creation.

Task 6 integration compiles the pinned Zodiac Delay v1.1.1 source at commit `30f3aafa9b3be3425bcac390fe6ab6bd9afb5f16` as `contracts/test/ZodiacDelayV1_1_1.sol`. This is a test fixture, not a production artifact or deployment claim. Its test-only Zodiac core compatibility surface exists solely because the installed zodiac-core package uses newer transient-storage syntax than the repository's pinned Solidity compiler; it is not a deployment dependency or a substitute for deployed bytecode verification. The production resolver fails closed when official deployment evidence is absent, before accepting an address or runtime hash.

Task 7 adds no new dependency. `npm run package:sepolia-rehearsal` packages only public unsigned artifacts derived from the redacted Sepolia config: unsigned plan, decoded review, public manifest, and expected evidence hashes. It rejects signatures, secrets, RPC URLs, private keys, Burner PINs, broadcast instructions, and recovery fields before writing package files. The package is review material only; live Sepolia execution and independent review remain outstanding.

## 2026-10-09 Single-Owner Validation

No dependency versions or lockfiles changed. The automated harness uses Node's native P-256 cryptography and packaged `@safe-global/safe-passkey@0.2.0` SafeWebAuthnSignerFactory and FCLP256Verifier artifacts. Assertions pass through actual ERC-1271 passkey contracts in the local EVM. This validates software-generated WebAuthn signatures, not hardware presence, device user verification, the canonical Daimo deployment, or live-chain compatibility. The Zodiac compatibility fixture remains local-only and must never become the live deployment artifact.

The modified TieredSpendingGuard runtime hash is `0x9321a6a896d85ec04efe82171b12f5f93c4e0c4ea9b34eb376b63ddbbb4ec070`; GuardReplacementMaintenance pins that artifact for replacement. This is a local build binding, not an independent review or deployed-code verification. Slither baseline updates retain line-specific detection and document the new intentional configuration-tuple read.

The bootstrap live runner is available only for a funder self-probe and factory-bound automated passkey signer creation. Vault deployment and spending remain unavailable until a reproducible deployment package, exact upstream Delay deployment artifact, instance runtime bindings, and audit evidence are reviewed. No dependency is approved merely because the local integration suite passes.

## 2026-10-14 Artifact Resolution Boundary

No package version changed. The deployment planner no longer accepts caller-supplied creation bytecode or expected runtime hashes. `reviewed-artifacts.ts` obtains Safe proxy creation code from the pinned and already runtime-verified Safe v1.5 proxy factory, parses the exact SHA-256-pinned Zodiac Delay v1.1.1 source, and derives local constructor payloads for the repository contracts. It obtains expected runtime hashes through read-only EVM creation simulation, including the Safe proxy instantiated with the pinned singleton. The artifact object and resulting deployment plan are opaque runtime evidence; structural JSON cannot pass the planner or deployment sequencer.

This validates source/version/binding provenance for an unsigned Sepolia plan. It does not add an independent audit, approve the local guard contracts for production, or authorize broadcasting. The future CLI adapter must still verify the source fetch response, gas bounds, receipts, all constructor bindings, and final topology before recording any live deployment as evidence.

## Codacy PR #2 dependency findings

Codacy PR #2 identified transitive `elliptic@6.5.4` and `ws` 7.x/8.x releases with security findings. `elliptic` is pinned through an npm override to `6.6.1`; `ws` is pinned by major family (`7.5.11` and `8.21.3`) so the Ethers 5 and Ethers 6 consumers retain their respective major APIs. These are tooling and signer-library transitive dependencies, not direct vault runtime dependencies. Their exact resolution is recorded in `package-lock.json`; rerun the test suite after any override change.

Codacy also reported `@openzeppelin/contracts@3.4.2-solc-0.7` under `@uniswap/v3-periphery`. For CVE-2021-39167, this is a package-alias false positive: [OpenZeppelin's advisory](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-fg47-3c2x-m2wr) explicitly lists `3.4.2-solc-0.7` as the patched release. Do not replace it with a different Solidity-major package to silence that finding.

The separate CVE-2021-46320 initializer finding is valid for this upstream package version, but its affected contracts are not part of this repository's compiled or executed code. The package is present only through Safe Passkey → Account Abstraction → Uniswap V3 Periphery; no first-party Solidity imports Uniswap or Account Abstraction contract sources. Keep its Codacy issue marked not exploitable for this repository, and revisit before introducing either dependency's Solidity sources into a build or deployment path. Other lower-severity `uuid` and `bn.js` findings are outside this critical/high remediation scope.
