# Sepolia testnet runbook

This runbook is for the single-Safe security-core prototype on Sepolia only (`chainId 11155111`). It is security research, not a production wallet. Never use it for mainnet, production funds, or live broadcast from the planner. The examples are redacted, not deployed, and contain no secrets.

## Hard stop rules

Stop immediately and do not sign, broadcast, deposit funds, or continue rehearsal if any read-only check differs from the reviewed plan. A mismatch in any of the following is a hard failure:

- chain, Safe address, or exactly three owners `[passkey, Burner, recovery]`;
- threshold, zero fallback handler, transaction guard, or module guard;
- enabled Safe modules (Delay must be the only one);
- guard or Delay address, runtime bytecode hash, signer identity, policy hash, or dependency hash;
- X/Y asset policy, per-transaction caps, token/recipient allowlist, counter values, period anchor, or 86,400-second period;
- Delay owner, avatar, target, only enabled upstream module, cooldown Z, or expiration;
- queue transaction fingerprint, setup transaction hash, or independently observed notification;
- any unexpected approval, message-signing, batch, delegate-call, fallback, module, owner, or recovery path.

The verifier must fail closed on missing RPC reads, missing bytecode, malformed data, unknown addresses, unavailable counters, or an unexpected extra field that changes the reviewed call graph. Monitoring and UI classification are evidence only; neither authorizes execution.

## Inputs and outputs

`config/sepolia.example.json` is a public, redacted input template. `deployments/sepolia.example.json` is a public manifest template. Replace example addresses and hashes only after a separate human review; never add private keys, passkey material, Burner PINs, seed phrases, provider tokens, or private RPC credentials.

Generate an unsigned, reproducible plan:

```sh
npx ts-node scripts/plan-deployment.ts config/sepolia.example.json /tmp/sepolia-plan.json
```

Review every decoded setup call against `docs/security/call-graph.md` before any human-controlled signing workflow. The output must say `"unsigned": true` and `"broadcast": false`. This script never signs or broadcasts.

Verify using a separately collected public read-only snapshot:

```sh
npx ts-node scripts/verify-deployment.ts deployments/sepolia.example.json /tmp/sepolia-observed.json
```

Archive the unsigned plan, public manifest, observed snapshot, verification report, report hash, block number, and source revision as the evidence bundle. Redact logs before sharing.

## Rehearsal sequence

Use deliberately low-value test assets and clean test accounts. Refuse chain ID 1 at every step.

1. Read and record chain ID, bytecode, owners, threshold, fallback, both guard slots, the single Safe module, Delay topology, policy, counters, and notification destinations.
2. Verify the atomic setup plan is unsigned and byte-stable across two generations. Do not broadcast it from this repository.
3. Exercise a native/ERC-20 base transfer within per-transaction and X limits. Confirm it consumes both X and shared Y.
4. Exercise a step-up transfer requiring the configured passkey and Burner. Confirm it consumes shared Y, emits the step-up alert, and cannot be authorized by Burner or recovery alone.
5. Attempt unsupported calldata, approvals, Permit/Permit2, batches, delegate calls, arbitrary messages, unknown recipients, and direct owner/module bypasses. Each must fail closed.
6. Attempt a transfer above Y directly. Confirm it cannot execute; queue the exact fingerprint through Delay with passkey plus Burner approval.
7. Confirm the delayed lifecycle alert, cancel the queue item, and prove the cancelled fingerprint cannot execute. Repeat with expiry and prove stale execution fails.
8. Queue a fresh low-value delayed transfer, advance Z, execute it, and reconcile the exact fingerprint and alert.
9. Freeze instant tiers, rehearse lost-factor recovery, signer rotation, and teardown. Recovery may cancel/freeze or queue enumerated repair only; it must not immediately transfer or weaken policy.
10. Re-run the complete read-only verifier after every state transition and retain failures. Do not accept “the UI showed the right tier” as proof.

## Evidence and architecture gate

The rehearsal is incomplete unless the evidence bundle proves one Safe holds assets, both guard paths are constrained, Delay is the only module, passkey-only spending is bounded by X, combined immediate spending by Y, transfers above Y wait Z and are cancellable, recovery cannot withdraw immediately, and both notification classes were independently observed.

Any security property that depends only on UI classification, monitoring, relayer honesty, or operator discipline fails the architecture gate. Do not deploy to mainnet or describe this prototype as production-ready or audited. Independent review and a professional audit remain mandatory.
