# Local EURC wallet backend

`apps/backend` is a loopback-only Ethereum Sepolia testnet backend for the browser wallet. It is required for passkey registration, reviewed vault provisioning, exact Safe transaction preparation, relay submission, and uncertain-broadcast reconciliation.

This is security research and testnet prototype code. It is not a production service. Do not use mainnet, real funds, hosted authentication, WalletConnect, arbitrary token calls, or secrets from this repository.

## Run

Keep relay keys, RPC URLs, credential metadata, and journal data outside the repository. Set:

```sh
export BACKEND_RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
export BACKEND_RPC_URL=https://...
export BACKEND_JOURNAL_PATH=/absolute/path/outside/repository/backend-journal.json
export BACKEND_REVIEWED_ARTIFACTS=/absolute/path/outside/repository/reviewed-artifacts.json
export BACKEND_PROVISIONER_MODULE=/absolute/path/outside/repository/reviewed-backend-adapter.mjs
export BACKEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
npm --prefix apps/backend run dev
```

The server binds to `127.0.0.1:8787`. `BACKEND_PROVISIONER_MODULE` must export the pinned Sepolia EURC address, a reviewed provisioner, and exact preparation, submission, and receipt-reconciliation adapters. Startup must fail when any required configuration, reviewed deployment evidence, or adapter is missing. The browser's EURC field is advisory and is never selected for deployment.

## HTTP contract

All responses are JSON with `cache-control: no-store`. Errors use `{ "error": string }`. Requests with an `Origin` must match `BACKEND_ORIGIN`; non-loopback clients are rejected.

- `GET /health` returns process readiness, `{ ok, chainId, origin }`. It does not claim that a vault is provisioned or that chain state is healthy.
- `POST /v1/registrations/{primary|secondary}/options` creates a one-use platform, user-verified WebAuthn registration session.
- `POST /v1/registrations/{primary|secondary}/verify` verifies the matching registration ceremony and stores only credential metadata.
- `POST /v1/vaults` provisions a fresh reviewed Safe topology from the two verified credential IDs and the pinned Sepolia EURC candidate. Browser deployment addresses and hashes are ignored.
- `POST /v1/submissions/prepare` re-reads the server-held vault and chain state, then journals one exact allowlisted EURC `transfer(address,uint256)` Safe `CALL`.
- `POST /v1/submissions/{id}/submit` verifies the role signature over the journaled Safe digest, requires primary before secondary, and relays only the unchanged prepared request.
- `GET /v1/submissions/{id}` returns journal state. It never authorizes a retry.

The backend relay account pays gas only. Safe owners, the spending guard, Delay, EURC metadata, topology, nonce, limits, recipient policy, receipts, and cancellation remain authoritative onchain or in reviewed security-core adapters. Preparation passes only recipient, amount, and idempotency intent from the browser; the adapter must derive the exact Safe transaction from the server-held vault and fresh chain reads.

## Verify

```sh
npm --prefix apps/backend test
```

Live Sepolia rehearsal remains separately authorized, capped, and recorded. No backend test proves hardware/WebAuthn UX or production readiness.
